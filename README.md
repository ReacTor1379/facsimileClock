PixelClock
==============

    应该是在Google I/O 2011期间谷歌放出过一个倒计时钟的网页，效果和这个Demo相同，我非常喜欢。
    这次尝试Dart，正好有这个钟的Sample Code，我就模仿做了一个，于是就有了这个facsimileClock。
    
    拆解分析代码并且重制的过程是很有趣的，能学习到很多思考方法，我还发现了一个小bug：

    感觉Dart兼顾了OOP的良好结构和javascript的灵活性，许多特性也很棒.

    


  During the the time of Google I/O 2011, I saw a webpage published by Google,which a count down clock consist by many 
balls on the page.When the time passes,some balls falling down and collide with each other.I like it very much.

  So,this time,when I'm trying to use Dart,I found a sample code of a clock just like the count down clock and I decide to 
make it.Then,when I finished,it was the PixelClock. 

  Read and split the sample code was a great journey,by that I learnt many ideas and skills of programming.And I found a
little bug of the sample code:

  After use it to built the clock.I think Dart is a language that combine the good structure of the OOP and the flexibility
of javascript.Many features are very useful for coding.
